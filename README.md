## Description

The focus of our porject was to create a site where users could log in using a valid email and password and be able to look at jokes posted by other users. Beyond just looking at the jokes posted by fellow users, people could leave a comment under the joke and upvote it in order to create an environment of interactiveness and community among the visitors of our site. With this site, people from all over the globe can take these jokes and share them with friends, family members, etc., and we could help make the world a better place one laugh at a time.

## Usage

When you get to the site, you are greeted with a list of jokes in a descending order from most upvoted to least upvoted. All of the jokes are displayed on a card in which you can see the tile of the joke, how many upvotes it has, the user who posted the joke, and the date they posted it.

When you click on a joke of your choice, you will be taken to the joke itself and you can see what it says. In this example, we have a vampire joke and below the card, you can see all the things listed previously like the user that posted the joke, when they posted it, etc. In addition to that, you can see how many people left a comment for this particular joke and when they posted their comment.

Now normally, there would be options like upvoting and commenting ourself, but we cannot do that because wer are not logged in. This sets up the next portion we will discuss, which is the login page:

When you click the sign up button in the upper right-hand corner, you will be taken to this form. If you are not already a member, you will need to enter a username of your choice, your email, and a password. If you are already a member, you can click the "I'm already a member" link at the bottom of the form, and you will be taken to a different one where you can enter your login information. The form should resemble something like this:
<img src="./assets/imgs/Member Login Screenshot.png" width="60%" height="60%">

It is fairly similar to the sign up form, and you just enter your email and password to continue browsing jokes and upvote and comment yourself! If you thought you were a member but maybe realized that you were in fact not a member, you can click the "Sign Up" link and it should take you back to the sign up form where you can sign up to become a member of Dadabase!

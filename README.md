## Description

The focus of our porject was to create a site where users could log in using a valid email and password and be able to look at jokes posted by other users. Beyond just looking at the hokes posted by fellow users, people could leave a comment under the joke and upvote it in order to create an environment of interactiveness and community among the visitors of our site. With this site, people from all over the globe can take these jokes and share them with friends, family members, etc., and we could help make the world a better place one laugh at a time.
